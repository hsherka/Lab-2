    "In this lab, I took data on New York's distribution of lottery money towards school aid in the years 2002 - 2004. From this, I looked for and found the most aid given, the least aid given, and average aid given to each school district. I got this data from data.gov, I know it is reputable because it is a government website. This is the link to the untouched data set https://data.ny.gov/api/views/9ypc-vjig/rows.csv . "

    "I removed the header columns and split the aid data into five lists: beginning year, ending year, county, district, and aid recieved. *There is also another list called unnecessary, and that was added in later.* I added unnecessary because the original county list had a mix of capital and lowercase letters, so when I divided data by county, it would not recognize counties as the same if they weren't typed in the same cases. I had to make a duplicate column of counties, but used the text function on excel to make them all lowercase. The steps I took to do this is create a new column, select the old column, selected formulas, then text, then lower. I then selected the new blank column, and dragged down on the first box so it would apply to all the cells in the column. I went back in this document and named the old column containing the mixed-case counties \"unnecessary\". I had to keep that column for the change I made to stay."

This information made me wonder how a school district could make 105 when the average given is millions of dollars more than that. It also made me wonder how the money given to districts from the lottery is distributed. These are questions up for future investigation. \n"
